npm install express-session connect-mongo


Debugging / Additional Features -------------->
- proper routing from comments redirect
- create way for comments to be pushed all on same page without redirection ideally
- mongodb username/password mgmt
- register path displays messages depending on input
    ie. 'Username already exists' , 'Email is already used'
- Edit Username (possibly password) page on mongodb
- Option to like and/or favorite a post

- route to favorites - would most likely need to push into a favorites array
    within user schema, render as list on favorites page
