Debugging / Additional Features -------------->
- proper routing from comments redirect
- create way for comments to be pushed all on same page without redirection ideally
- mongodb username/password mgmt
- 'register' path displays messages depending on input
    ie. 'Username already exists' , 'Email is already used'
- Edit Username (possibly password) page on mongodb
- Option to like and/or favorite a post
- Have navbar update when user is logged in and when user is logged out
- Add timestamp to comments


- route to favorites - would most likely need to push into a favorites array
    within user schema, render as list on favorites page
    - includes button under individual posts to add to fav array


- refactor ejs pages <%if (authUser == true) %>
    - most likely need auth middleware to refactor
    - authUser defined within router.get
