Admin Account
 - username - admin
 - password - admin

Debugging / Additional Features -------------->
- Option to bookmark post
    - route to bookmarks - would most likely need to push into array
    within user schema, render as list on bookmarks page
    - includes button under individual posts to add to bookmarks array

Stretch Goals --------->
- Edit Username (possibly password) page on mongodb (Edit Profile Page)
    - replace search bar with profile drop-down menu
    - take into account how req.session.thisUser would be impacted when using edit features
- Add timestamp to comments
- Search Bar - styling issues
