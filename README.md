# Bravado

Bravado is a site where people share interview experience as well as knowledge about the interview process that will allow others to study or use as reference for how to ace their own upcoming interviews.

The site will act in similar fashion to a forum with posts categorized by the type of industry people interviewed in. Users will be able to post their content in the different sections corresponding to the industry they interviewed in. Readers will be able to post comments under the posts.
