        <div class= "about">
            
            <p class="about-sec">Bravado is a company that started in early 1937. It was started by Michael Schwartzenberg as a company to help during the great depression. During this time getting jobs was a very difficult task, as such he decided he needed to find a solution. The area he decided to target was the interview process. 
                He knew that if you couldn't get past the interview you could kiss that job goodbye. 

                He would start his planning phase and he would begin to create what is now known as Bravado Industries. Ever since Mr. Schwartzenberg’s passing in 1989, he would pass the torch to his daughter Andrea.

                 Today she leads the company with the same goal in mind: help those inexperienced, or simply nervous, land their first job and knock that interview out of the park.
